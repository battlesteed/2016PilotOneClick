# 2016PilotOneClick
2016 Honda Pilot One-Click Root &amp; App Installation Tool

This project is a collection of utilities & scripts to get root access on a 2016 model Honda Pilot head unit, as well as simplifying installation of third party (non-Honda) apps.

dirtyCOW exploit: I based a different implementation of the dirtyCOW exploit on the below code:

In an effort to maintain fewer scripts to use on both Windows and Linux platforms, use of win-bash was used, located here:

The scripts also assume working installations of the Android Software Development Kit and a working Java runtime environment. 

Contributions are welcome and encouraged - keep in mind this is a hobby project for a father of two with a (separate! haha) full-time job, so I may at times be slow to respond.
